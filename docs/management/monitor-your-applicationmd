# Monitor Your Application

It's beneficial to have a way to monitor your application, allowing you to check resource usage, network traffic, and more. For instance, by setting up a node-exporter service in your Docker Compose file, you can connect it with Grafana to enable real-time monitoring.

```python
  # Grafana metrics with node_exporter
  services:
	  node_exporter:
	    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest
	    container_name: node_exporter
	    command:
	      - '--path.rootfs=/host'
	    network_mode: host
	    pid: host
	    restart: unless-stopped
	    volumes:
	      - '/:/host:ro,rslave'
	
```
