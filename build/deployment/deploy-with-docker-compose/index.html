<h1 id="deploy-with-docker-compose">Deploy with Docker Compose</h1>

<p>Switch to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the deployment section to edit the Docker Compose file. Deploying with Docker Compose on Phala TEE Cloud is the same as on a general server. You can specify the image name, such as <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image: phalanetwork/eliza:v0.1.6-alpha.4</code></strong>, and configure the <strong>PORT</strong> exposing. You can also configure multiple services within the same Docker Compose file, and these Docker containers will run inside the same CVM.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your Docker image private, we support private deployment. Check the <strong>Deploy with Private Docker Image</strong> section for more information.</p>
