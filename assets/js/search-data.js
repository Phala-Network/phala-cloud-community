No, it‚Äôs encrypted on the client side and sent to the CVM using X25519 encryption scheme. The variables can only be decrypted inside the CVM.        Can Docker logs be accessed by any other part, including the host OS?    Currently, the logs are not end-to-end encrypted. However, you can decide whether to make them public under Advanced Features ‚Üí Public Logs during deployment. If you choose public, anyone with the log URL can view them, and the Log URL can be inferred from your instance ID in the public endpoints. If you choose private, no one can access the logs, and you‚Äôll need to configure a log viewer to view them elsewhere.        Is application data persistent on the disk?    Yes, the data you write to the filesystem inside Docker will persist on the disk and be encrypted. Restarting or upgrading will not affect data recovery. To save data on disk, you need to configure volumes in the Docker Compose file and write data to the correct path.        How can others verify that my application is running inside a TEE?    Once the application is successfully launched, you can prove this by providing the RA Report, which can be exported through an endpoint by your Docker application.

To make your Docker logs private, you can configure a log viewer in the Docker Compose file. For example, you can use the open-source log viewer Dozzle.      Generate user data    On your local machine, generate a Dozzle user authority token using the Dozzle container by running the following command. In this example, we set the username as ‚ÄúAdmin,‚Äù the password as ‚Äúsecret,‚Äù and the role as ‚Äúadmin.‚Äù     docker run amir20/dozzle generate --name Admin --email me@email.net --password secret admin | base64 -w 1000            Then, setup Dozzle in Docker compose file.     services:   # Viewable logs with dozzle   setup:     image: busybox     restart: \"no\"     volumes:       - dozzle-data:/dozzle-data/     command: &gt;       sh -c 'echo \"use authority token\" | base64 -d &gt; /dozzle-data/users.yml || true'       dozzle:     container_name: dozzle     image: amir20/dozzle:latest     depends_on:       - setup     environment:       - DOZZLE_AUTH_PROVIDER=simple     volumes:       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock       - dozzle-data:/data/     ports:       - 8080:8080            Once the application is running, you will only be able to view the logs using the username and password you set earlier, accessed through the relevant container‚Äôs public endpoint.
